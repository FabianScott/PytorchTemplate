Contains a .py file for running the entire thing at once along with a more pedagogical jupyter notebook. There is code for turning numpy data into tensors along with a simple error calculatoin and plot at the end. The main class 'MLP' contains basic methods for a Neural Network, and is meant as a basis upon which to expand and improve the functionality one wishes to implement in ones specific case. There are comments in the class meantioning various additional features one can implement to improve the network's performance.
